# 32-bit MIPS Single Cycle Processor

This project was made a culmination of 3 courses:
- Digital Design
- Computer Architecture and Organization
- Hardware Lab

The processor implemeted supports a subset of the core MIPS instruction set:

• The memory reference instructions: load word (lw) and store words (sw) 
• The arithmetic-logical instructions: add, sub, and, or, and set-less-than (slt) 
• Control transfer instructions: branch equal (beq) and jump (j)  
• Instruction for supporting subroutine: jump and link (jal)

Note that the instruction set is complete, ie, any meaningful program can be implemeted with the above instructions...

## Files/Folders

The project contains the following files/folders:

- `datapath.v`: datapath involving all the data submodules, takes input from MIPS and ALU controller
- `datamodules.v`: TBD
- `MIPS_controller.v`: TBD
- `ALU_controller.v`: TBD
- `top.v`: TBD
- `data_mem.dat`: TBD
- `instr_mem.dat`: TBD
- `testbench.v` : TBD

NOTE: More files to be added


## Usage
TBD
